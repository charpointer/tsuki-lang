# tsuki-lang
A simple toy language written in Python using Lark.

## Variables
```lua
-- Tsuki supports Lua style comments too!

-- name is a string in this case, a python str()
name = "charlotte"

-- we can assign a new variable to the value of a variable
hername = name

-- age is an number, which maps to a python int()
age = 19

-- manesix is an array of strings, which maps to a python list()
manesix = ["Twilight", "Rarity", "Fluttershy", "Applejack", "Pinkie Pie", "Spike"]
```
